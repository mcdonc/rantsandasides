Rants and Asides: YouTube Videos That I Love
============================================

- I am partial to interviews, especially of quirky people.

- Most of these videos are one-offs, found organically, not part of a series.

- Apologies, I did not rewatch all of these to make this video, my descriptions
  will be surface-level on some, but all are highly entertaining.

- I omitted the music (which is at least 30% of my YouTube watching).

- Don't consider a listing here an endorsement.

- But if you saw my YouTube history, I would be cancelled.
